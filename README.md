# 🧠 Algorithms & Problem Solving — Flowcharts Only

This repository contains a collection of **algorithmic and problem-solving exercises** that I solved **exclusively using flowcharts**.

⚠️ **No programming code was used** in this repository.
Each solution is designed and explained visually using **flowchart logic**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Strengthen **algorithmic thinking**
* Practice **problem decomposition**
* Learn how to convert problem statements into **step-by-step logic**
* Prepare for implementation in any programming language later

Flowcharts help in understanding **how an algorithm works**, not just how to write code.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **draw.io** (diagrams.net)
* Each file has the `.drawio` extension

## 📌 Notes

* All solutions are **logic-based**
* No specific programming language is assumed
* These flowcharts can be implemented later in:

  * C++
  * Java
  * Python
  * Any other language

---

## 🚀 Next Step

The next stage is to **convert these flowcharts into real code**
(starting with C++, Java, or Python).
